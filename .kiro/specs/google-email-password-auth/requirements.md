# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add Google email and password authentication as an alternative login method for admin users, complementing the existing Google OAuth authentication. Admin users will be able to sign in using their Google email address and password directly, without going through the OAuth flow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to sign in using my Google email and password directly, so that I can access the admin panel without going through the OAuth flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin visits the signin page THEN the system SHALL display both Google OAuth and email/password login options
2. WHEN an admin enters their Google email and password THEN the system SHALL authenticate them against Google's authentication service
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the admin to the admin dashboard
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. IF the email is not in the allowed admin emails list THEN the system SHALL deny access with an appropriate message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the email/password form to be user-friendly and accessible, so that I can easily sign in on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the signin page loads THEN the system SHALL display a clean, responsive email/password form
2. WHEN an admin types in the email field THEN the system SHALL validate the email format in real-time
3. WHEN an admin types in the password field THEN the system SHALL mask the password characters
4. WHEN an admin clicks the show/hide password button THEN the system SHALL toggle password visibility
5. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear, helpful error messages
6. WHEN the form is submitted THEN the system SHALL show a loading state during authentication

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want email/password authentication to use the same security controls as OAuth, so that the system maintains consistent security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to sign in with email/password THEN the system SHALL verify the email is in the ALLOWED_ADMIN_EMAILS environment variable
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL create the same session structure as OAuth authentication
3. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL apply the same middleware protection to admin routes
4. IF the authentication provider is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and inform the user
5. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the signin page

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the email/password authentication to integrate seamlessly with the existing NextAuth setup, so that maintenance and future updates are straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing email/password auth THEN the system SHALL use NextAuth's credentials provider
2. WHEN a user signs in with either method THEN the system SHALL create compatible session objects
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate that all required environment variables are present
4. WHEN authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL log appropriate information for debugging and monitoring
5. IF configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about what needs to be configured
